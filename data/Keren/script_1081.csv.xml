54009,STU,You remember Jay Crespi.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54010,GEORGE,"Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54011,STU,This is James Kimbrough.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54012,KIMBROUGH,"Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54013,GEORGE,Kimbrough.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54014,JERRY,Don't spell.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54015,GEORGE,K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54016,KIMBROUGH,That's right.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54017,GEORGE,It's a talent I have.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54018,KIMBROUGH,"Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54019,GEORGE,Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54020,JERRY,"Shut up, George.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54021,KIMBROUGH,Can I get you anything?,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54022,GEORGE,What do we have in the fruit department?,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54023,JERRY,Oy.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54024,STU,Pineapple.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54025,GEORGE,"Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54026,KIMBROUGH,"Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54027,GEORGE,"Been there, done that.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54028,KIMBROUGH,Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54029,GEORGE,Water coolers?,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54030,CRESPI,We call it a water-cooler show.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54031,JERRY,"Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54032,GEORGE,"See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54033,JERRY,"Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than ""coffee machine show.""",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54034,GEORGE,It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54035,JERRY,But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54036,KIMBROUGH,"Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he developed five years ago.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54037,STU,I have always loved it.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54038,KIMBROUGH,"He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54039,CRESPI,He totally flipped out.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54040,KIMBROUGH,"What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54041,JERRY,He's a little off the wall.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54042,CRESPI,Oh yeah.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54043,STU,Kramer.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54044,KIMBROUGH,And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54045,JERRY,Definitely.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54046,GEORGE,"I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54047,KIMBROUGH,"Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54048,GEORGE,Or we could get them together. Woo!,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54049,GEORGE,Yeah!,23.0,S09E23,9.0
