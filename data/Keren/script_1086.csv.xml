54255,GEORGE,That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54256,KRAMER,The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54257,ELAINE,"Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54258,DEPUTY,"Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54259,JERRY,"Oh, yeah.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54260,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54261,DEPUTY,"You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54262,GEORGE,"All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54263,DEPUTY,"Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54264,ELAINE,What?,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54265,GEORGE,Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54266,DEPUTY,"California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54267,CHILES,Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.,23.0,S09E23,9.0

54269,CHILES,"You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about.

54270,HOYT,"So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54271,KRAMER,"Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?",23.0,S09E23,9.0

54273,ELAINE,I guess we could've called for help.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54274,JERRY,But then we would have missed the whole thing.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54275,KRAMER,I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.,23.0,S09E23,9.0

54280,JERRY,Plane's ready.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54281,RIVERA,"Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-",23.0,S09E23,9.0

54285,RIVERA,And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?,23.0,S09E23,9.0

54287,RIVERA,"Anything else, Jane?",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54288,WELLS,"There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54289,RIVERA,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54290,HELEN,I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.,23.0,S09E23,9.0

54297,MORTY,So bring a snack-pack.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54298,ESTELLE,"Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54299,FRANK,Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
