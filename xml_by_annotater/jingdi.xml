Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on.

Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.",1.0,S01E01,1.0

I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?",1.0,S01E01,1.0

54019,GEORGE,Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54020,JERRY,"Shut up, George.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54021,KIMBROUGH,Can I get you anything?,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54022,GEORGE,What do we have in the fruit department?,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54023,JERRY,Oy.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54024,STU,Pineapple.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54025,GEORGE,"Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54026,KIMBROUGH,"Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54027,GEORGE,"Been there, done that.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54028,KIMBROUGH,Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54029,GEORGE,Water coolers?,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54030,CRESPI,We call it a water-cooler show.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54031,JERRY,"Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54032,GEORGE,"See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54033,JERRY,"Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than ""coffee machine show.""",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54034,GEORGE,It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54035,JERRY,But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54036,KIMBROUGH,"Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he developed five years ago.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54037,STU,I have always loved it.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54038,KIMBROUGH,"He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54039,CRESPI,He totally flipped out.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54040,KIMBROUGH,"What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54041,JERRY,He's a little off the wall.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54042,CRESPI,Oh yeah.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54043,STU,Kramer.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54044,KIMBROUGH,And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54045,JERRY,Definitely.,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54046,GEORGE,"I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54047,KIMBROUGH,"Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54048,GEORGE,Or we could get them together. Woo!,23.0,S09E23,9.0

54064,MORTY,"They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.",23.0,S09E23,9.0
54065,HELEN,She's not six-six.,23.0,S09E23,9.0

54081,ESTELLE,I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54082,FRANK,Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!,23.0,S09E23,9.0
54083,GEORGE,I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.,23.0,S09E23,9.0

I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed.

You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty.
